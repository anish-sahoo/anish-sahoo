### I am currently working on: *Anime Discovery Engine*
>A full-fledged recommendation/personalization system to discover new anime, built on a microservice architecture with Java Spring and Python grpcio services and postgres+elasticsearch. I get the data from myanimelist using a python etl pipeline, and generate embeddings using a HuggingFace minilm model, before pushing the data to elasticsearch. This stack is deployed on my personal server, and is instrumented with Grafana Alloy+Cloud for metrics/traces/logs. I am currently designing the frontend for this application.
